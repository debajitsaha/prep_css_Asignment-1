        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in olay media</li>
            <li><span id="id1">Ess is not neccesary </span><span class="id2"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li><span id="id3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span> </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Css Can Be Added to HTML Document In 3 Way :</h2>
   <div id="id4"> <ul>
        <LI>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</LI>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="id2"> in this

            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul></div>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is alse special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
     <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
     <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
